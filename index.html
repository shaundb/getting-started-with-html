<h2>The Code</h2>

<p>Code is the instructions a programmer creates for a computer to run programmes and tasks in a syntax it understands.
Computers can be said to be <em>stupid</em> as they need to follow this syntax exactly.
There can be no general interpretations of what the computer thinks the programmer may mean. 
The computer is very unforgiving to any mistakes the prgrammer may make in their code. 
Maybe the rise of Ai will help us with this? 
Programmers will struggle to remember all the details of a given code language variant but this is 
fine as there is a wealth of resources online</p>

<h2>HTML Basics</h2>
